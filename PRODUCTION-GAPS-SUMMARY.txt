STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY - 3 Critical Blockers

CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
==================

🔴 1. AUTENTIQUE SERVICE NOT INTEGRATED
   Files: /includes/integrations/elementor/class-ajax-handler.php:320-327
          /includes/integrations/elementor/actions/class-formflow-action.php:358-362
   Issue: Signature feature has TODO comments, returns null, no handlers exist
   Impact: Digital signature (core feature) is non-functional
   Effort: 2-3 days

🔴 2. CRON SCHEDULE "five_minutes" NOT REGISTERED  
   Files: /includes/class-activator.php:147
   Issue: WordPress doesn't have built-in five_minutes interval
   Impact: Queue processing fails completely
   Effort: 1 hour to register filter

🔴 3. 8 FAILING TESTS
   Files: /tests/unit/Integrations/Autentique/
   Issue: Phase 8 Autentique integration incomplete
   Impact: CI/CD pipeline fails
   Effort: 1-2 days after Blocker #1

MAJOR GAPS:
===========

HIGH PRIORITY:
- Duplicate Autentique implementations (snake_case vs PSR-4)
- No default options for logs retention/archive settings
- README.md outdated (claims Phase 2 complete)
- Cache cleanup cron has no handler

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- Language files empty (i18n structure only)
- Queue schedule conflict (5-min vs hourly)
- No admin config UI for API key
- Missing production deployment checklist

COMPLETE & OK:
==============
✓ Database tables created (logs, queue)
✓ Webpack build system working
✓ Assets compiled 
✓ Uninstall.php complete
✓ Activation/deactivation basic flow
✓ i18n infrastructure present
✓ Test infrastructure in place

PRODUCTION READINESS ESTIMATE:
==============================
Current: ~40% ready
With Critical Fixes: ~85% ready  
Time to Fix: 3-4 days
Time to Full Production: 1-2 weeks (with Polish/Admin UI)

FILES WITH GAPS:
================
/includes/integrations/elementor/class-ajax-handler.php
/includes/integrations/elementor/actions/class-formflow-action.php
/includes/class-activator.php
/includes/queue/class-queue-manager.php
/includes/autentique/ (duplicate code - should remove)
/README.md (outdated)
/languages/ (empty)

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Register custom cron interval 'five_minutes' (1hr)
2. Wire Autentique service to queue (2hrs)
3. Add missing default options (30min)
4. Update/run tests (4hrs)
5. Consolidate Autentique code (2hrs)
6. Update documentation (2hrs)
